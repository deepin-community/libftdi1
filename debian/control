Package: ftdi-eeprom
Section: utils
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Tool for reading/erasing/flashing FTDI USB chip EEPROMs
 ftdi-eeprom is a small tool for creating and uploading the configuration
 EEPROM for the FTDI chip. This eeprom contains information such as vendor
 and product ID, manufacturer and product strings, revision, etc.

Package: libftdi1-2
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: C Library to control and program the FTDI USB controllers
 This library could talk to FTDI's FT232BM, FT245BM, FT2232C, FT2232D, FT245R,
 FT232H and FT230X type USB chips from userspace. It uses libusb 1.0 to
 communicate with the chips.
 .
 Functionalities include the possibility to use the chips in standard
 mode, in bitbang mode, and to read or write the serial EEPROM.
 .
 This is the C version of the library.
